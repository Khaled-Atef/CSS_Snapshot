           A novel is a long prose narrative that usually describes fictional characters 
           and events in the form of a sequential story. It rests on the consensus 
           that the novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose, followed by 
           the novella, novelette and the short story. However, there is no consensus as to the 
           minimal required lenght. In part because of this wide variation, the boundary
           between a novella and a novel may be arbitrary and difficult to determine.

                Oliver Twist; or, the Parish Boy's Progress is Charles Dickens's second novel, and was 
                published as a serial from 1837 to 1839 and released as a three-volume book in 1838, before the 
                serialisation ended.[1] The story centres on orphan Oliver Twist, born in a workhouse and 
                sold into apprenticeship with an undertaker. After escaping, Oliver travels to London, where he meets
                the "Artful Dodger", a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin.
